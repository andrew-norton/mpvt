# Members of Parliament Voting Trends

MPVT's intention is to provide something similar to FiveThirtyEight's [Does Your Member Of Congress Vote With Or Against Biden?](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-congress-votes/) for Canadian politicians. The project is very much in early stages at the moment and doesn't support a concise terminal output let alone a webpage to browse. 

There's no good way to make a one-to-one replica of what FiveThirtyEight did for Members of Parliament since there are many different parties (well, more than two at least) and no defacto head of state like the President (well, one that has power at least). What I've tried to do is show an estimate for how a Member *should have* voted based on how their constituency *would have* voted. The program will show you how often you'd expect a Member to agree with any of the parties and how often they actually agree.

The basic idea is calulating a Member's likelihood to affirm a vote but multiplying the proportion of votes in that Member's riding a party received last election by the proportion of said party Members that voted yes. Presumably, those voters would agree with the party they cast their ballot for and would want their representative to vote in that direction.
